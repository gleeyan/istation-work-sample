> 1) Create a software design for a basic vending machine. What are the functional components of the user interface? What are the possible states of the vending machine, and what are the transitions between those states? What are the functions of the vending machine? Create and submit written descriptions, flowcharts, state diagrams, etc. as necessary to document your design. We’re only interested in the functional design, not the visual/physical design.

> 2) Write Java code implementing the virtual vending machine you designed. Demonstrate your understanding of object-oriented design and good coding practices.

See [/src](src/) for project source files.

> 3) Write a command-line test program that allows a user to test your vending machine. The user should be able to see a list of snacks/prices, select a snack, put money into the machine, receive money back, etc.

See [/src/bshields/istation/tests](src/bshields/istation/tests/) for test program source files. See [/src/bshields/istation/tests/CommandLineTest.java](src/bshields/tests/CommandLineTest.java) for command-line test entry point.
